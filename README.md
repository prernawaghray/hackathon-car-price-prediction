# Car Price Prediction - Hackathon
The goal here is to develop an application which can predict the price of a refurbished car based on the variables provided in the dataset. You are required to build a regression model to predict the price of a given car.

Optional:- Develop a simple front UI which takes the given variables as inputs and displays the predicted price by calling the above regression model.
